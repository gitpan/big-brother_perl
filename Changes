Revision history for Perl extension BBPerl.

1.10 - Initial write.
1.20 - Fix for adding additional HTML code for the big brother server.
1.30 - Modified the sending routing to fork a new process rather than
       having the module to the work itself. This seemed to be needed
			 for many of our Solaris bretheren.
